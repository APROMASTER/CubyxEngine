Running on .NET 7.0, Visual studio Code v17

--------- About the project ---------

Right now there's no much stuff but 
maybe on the next updates I'll make more "engine components"

I was thinking on from now make Console menus
so like that you can manage projects in any folder
of your pc, maybe make something like commands to
control the game objects of a scene, or add components
but theres a problem, because right now its name-sensitive
so if a make a ID system it will be solved


(Someday maybe I'll put something more interesting here)
